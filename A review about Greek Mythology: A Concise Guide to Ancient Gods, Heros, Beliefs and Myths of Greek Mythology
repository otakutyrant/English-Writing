After recommending DK books before, I discovered a new and awesome brand again: Hourly History. The other day, in order to read a book, written in Chinese, about astrology, constellations and the corresponding English etymology, I familiarized myself with Greek mythology. But there are many more books than I thought, including illustrated books and even academic works. I had considered DK books, but the form of Greek mythology is mainly textual, rendering illustrations joyous but unnecessary and time-consuming. And I have no plans to become an expert in Greek mythology. So I searched "concise Greek mythology" on Amazon and eventually fount out this book brand.

As the name "Hourly History" suggests, you can pick up any subject that interests you in less than one hour. The brand has published 288 books so far, involving Hilter, the Cold War, Celtic Mythology, and so forth. Because the books are highly concise, all of them are made into ebooks directly. According to my investivation on Amazon, the brand focuses on biographies of famous people mainly, and it is a stroke of luck that almost all these books are Kindle Unlimited! Therefore, this brand is fully suitable for ESL learners, like me, who won't to spend a lot of time and money on those expensive and thick books.

As for this book, it took me two or three hours to finish it, proving that I still have a long way to go in terms of improving my reading skills! However, its required vocabulary is not higher than I thought, and an ESL learner who has a vocabulary of around 7000 words can get through this book with ease. What makes it imperfect is that it does not introduce the story of non-main roles like Medusa and Heracles. Nevertheless, it is enough to cover Greek mythology overall.

All of them can be used as adverbs and sometimes as nouns.

# familiarize sb with sth

# first, first of all, firstly vs at first, in the beginning.

First, firstly and first of all First, firstly and first of all introduce the first item in a list or sequence. The next item is normally introduced by then or second/secondly : ‘First, open all the windows. Then turn off the gas and, if necessary, call an ambulance.’ ‘These new computers have several advantages. First of all, they’re faster than the older machines. Secondly, they’re far easier to use. And thirdly, they’re more reliable.’

at first At first introduces a situation which is in contrast with a later situation (after a change has taken place): ‘At first I didn’t like the climate, but after two years I got used to it.’ 

In the beginning Like at first, in the beginning introduces a situation which is in contrast with a later situation. However, in the beginning is less common and suggests that the speaker is looking a long way back into the past to the period of time immediately after something began: ’In the beginning, when the first settlers arrived, law and order didn’t exist.’ 

# illustrated books

I have no plans to fight!

I want to improve my reading skills.
