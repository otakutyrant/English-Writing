I wrote a review about Greek Mythology: A Concise Guide to Ancient Gods, Heroes, Beliefs and Myths of Greek Mythology:

After the recommendation of DK public, I discoverd a new and funny brand again: Hourly History. On the other day, to read a book about constellations and corresponding English etymology, written in Chinese, I studied the Greek Mythology at first. But there are too many books than I thought, including illustrations and even academic works. I had considered some DK public books, but Greek Mythology is mainly textual at all, inducing illustarions joyous but unnecessary. And I have no plan to become an expert in Greek Mythology, so I searched "Greek Mythology concise" in Amazon and discovered this book brand finally.

Literal as Hourly History, you can pick up the subject you interested in less than an hour. Because it is so concise, all publications are made into e-books directly. The brand has published 283 books so far, involving Hilter, Cold War, Celtic Mythology and so on. According to my search in Amazon, this brand is about biography of famous people mainly, and luckily almost all books are kindleunlimited! So Hourly History is very suitable for ESL learners, like me, who are unable spend a lot of money or time in expensive and thick books to learn history due to limited conditions.

As for this book, I have spent two or three hours to read it, proving that I have a large space to improve my reading skill! However its required vocabulary is not higher than I thought. So an ESL learner who has about 7000 vocabulary can get over this book. What makes it imperfect is that it does not introduce the story of non-main roles like Medusa and Heracles. However it is enough to cover Greek Mythology at all.
