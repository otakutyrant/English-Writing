As an ESL reader, I spent a lot of time tyring to find some textbooks to learn terminology in some subjects like science, physics, chemistry, geography, history and so on. I considered American high school textbooks, international programs (like A-Level or IB) textbooks, and even Barun textbooks, but it was either too hard to acquire those textbooks or too complicated to study them. Luckily, I found out out about DK brand through a book *English for Everyone: English Vocabulary Builder*. DK books not only are illustrative and comprehensive, but also cover diverse subjects, including The Periodic Table Book which I have read already, and analogous books like The Science Book, The Mythology Book, and even The Crime Book. So books in this "The \_\_ Book" series are appropriate for learning terms in any subject that interests you.

Why did I learn the period table at first? Simply because I was playing a game called Oxygen Not Included, improvising survival tools, cozy furniture, heavy industrial facilities, and finally a space vehicle to go skyward. This procedure involves numerous chemical elements and intricate reactions.
