As an ESL reader, I spent a lot of time to find some textbooks to learn terminology words in some subjects like science, physics, chemistry, geography, history and so on. I considered American high school textbooks, international programs (like A-Level or IB) textbooks, or even Barun textbooks, but it was either too hard to get those textbooks or too complicated to study them. Luckily, I found out DK this brand through my first own book *English for Everyone: English Vocabulary Builder*. DK books is not only illustrative and comprehensive, but also covering catholic subjects, including The Periodic Table Book which has been read today, and analogous books like The Science Book, The Mythology Book, and even The Crime Book. So these series The Book are very useful for learning terms in any subject that attracts you.

Why did I learn the Periodic Table at first? Because I was playing *Oxygen not included*, involving numerous chemical elements and complicated reactions to make new things from scratch.
