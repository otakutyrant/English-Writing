Making 1505 Anki cards drained me utterly! English for Everyone: Vocabulary Builder, as the name suggests, is an up-to-date, essential and pure vocabulary book for ESL learners. It highly covers almost all everyday situations, including some animals sounds even. And what makes it more considerate is the discrimination of words between AmE and BrE, converse to a antediluvian and BrE-only "English in Use"" series which has been a waste of my time ever. By the way, this book is published by DK, containing plentiful and well-organized illustrations as usual.

Speaking of the Anki cards, they are flashcards used for memorizing things. Organizing them is really, really taxing. To lighten burden, skipping some trivial words is acceptable, like some cosmetics if you are male. If not in order to read English literature, maybe it is better off living in a real anglosphere environment to memorize everyday words implicitily, basically enough. However, when you are dealing with an urgent or important matter, for example how to find a place to relax or how to board a plane, you won't be stuck taking out a heavy dictionary from a cumbersome bag, opening it, and finally spending time on looking up some words. Hence you could memorize some essential words beforehand via this book, such as restroom, laboratory, boarding pass, airport, terminal and departure time.
