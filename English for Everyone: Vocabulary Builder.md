It drained me utterly! I have recored 1505 cards in Anki. Of course this is an up-to-date, essential and pure vocabulary book for all ESL learners, really covering almost all everyday situations, even including some sounds made by animals, and thoughtfully dividing words between AmE and BrE, unlike that antediluvian and BrE-only *English in Use* series which had wasted me a lot of time. And this book is published by DK too, containing colorful and plentiful illustrations as usual.

Recoding those new words into Anki is really, really taxing. To lighten burden, you can skip some unimportant words, like some cosmetics if you are male. If not in order to read English literature, maybe it is better off living in a real anglosphere environment and memorizing everyday words implicitily. However, you won't be stuck in consulting a dictionary at first when you are dealing with an urgent or important matter like how to find a place to relax or how to board on a plane, so you should memorze some essential words befhorehand throught this book, like restroom, boarding pass and so on.
