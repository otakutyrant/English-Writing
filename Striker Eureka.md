This reminded me of Striker Eureka. It is weird to me, a Chinese person, because I was accustomed to regard Eureka as an adjective. If it is just a name, putting it after Striker is rational.

The Chinese language often uses an “adj + noun” structure to comprise compounds, like Yellow River. But I cannot conjure up any example of a “noun + name” structure in Chinese. To put it differently, there may not be any “noun + name” compounds in Chinese, and I have never been aware of such a structure in English until this post. So my previous interpretaion of Striker Eureka, regarding Striker as a noun at first and then Eureka an adjective, was affected by my Chinese mindset principally.

# mind vs mindset

Mind is the place where you have all your thoughts, your imagination, etc.

Mindset is a general attitude, or assumptions towards something. For example, being racist would be considered an unhealthy mindset.
