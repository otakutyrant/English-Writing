This reminded me of Striker Eureka, strange to me, a Chiense person, because I was accustomed to regard Eureka as an adjective. If it is just a name, putting it after Striker is rational.

Because Chinese this language often use“adj + noun” this structure to comprise compounds, like Yellow River, and I cannot conjure up any example of “noun + name” this structure in Chinese. To put it differently, there may are not any “noun + name” compounds in Chinese, and I have never encountered this structure in English until this post. So my anterior understanding of Striker Eureka, regarding Striker as a noun at first and then Eureka an adjective, was affected by Chinese mind principally.
