Some young Americans are said to have joined a competition that who will be the fastest one to be infected by coronavirus. Some weeks later, one of them died of it. What he said last is that he thought it is just a hoax, but he was totally wrong.

I won't reproach or laugh at these people. Instead, I am impassive. Freedom is a good thing, but the true and dark essence of it is that everyone die where they desire and deserve. He died for the freedom of getting infected by coronavirus, and I live with the freedom of wearing a mask and keeping social distance every day. Of course, no one can assert what will happen in the future. I may die of an incident induced by wearing a mask incorrectly or something else like that, but I die where I desire and deserve anyway. This is freedom as well.
