Dear sir or madam,

  My name is Li Hua, a student from China. I have learned that Couchsurfing is a non-profit international network whereby members can stay at an accommodation provided by another member, as they travel to the other member's country. Now I apply for joining you.

  My house is at Tiantai, Zhejiang, China, semi-detached. It is four levels high, and has one living room, one kitchen, one small dining room, and two available living rooms. At all, it can accommodate three people as most as possible.

  I appreciate the aim of Couchsurfing, willing to attend the big family to know one another and share accommodations.

  If you accept my application, it couldn't be better. Thank you!

Li Hua
