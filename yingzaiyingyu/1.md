Dear sir or madam,
  My name is Li Hua, a student from China. I have learned that Couchsurfing is a non-profit international network. I apply for joining you.

  My house is at Tiantai, Zhejiang, China, half-detached. It is four levels high, and has one living room, one kitchen, one small dining room, and two available living rooms. At all, it can accommodate about three people.

  I appreciate the aim of Couchsurfing, willing to attend the big family to know
