Dear sir or madam,
  I have read your poster for recruting volunteers and I'd like to recommend myself with reasons as follow.

  I am Li Hua, 18, from a high school, in HangZhou, China. Through a decade of learning English, I am reputed to have gained considerable proficiency in English speaking.

  Furthermore, it is a stroke of luck that I exactly have been a volunteer in Beijing Olympic 2008, whereby I really acquired valuable experiences, proving that I can cope with the new challenge better than before, if you offer it.

  Thank you for reading my application. I appreciate your approval.

Li Hua
