Dear sir or madam,
  My name is Li Hua, a student from China. And I plan to go to Britian to attend your summer school. Graduated from a high school recently, I was looking for a way to go through a meaningful summer. Fortunately your advertisement compelled my attention in time. Then I would like to ask for more details:

  When does the course commence?
  How many students will attend the course?
  How much money should I prepare for the expenditure?
  What is the schedule of the course?
  Is there offical accommodations? If not, is there any advise about it?

  I appreciate your reply.

Li Hua
