Good morning,

  My name is Li HUa. I have an announcement to make. In order to work out, enjoy nature, and have fun, Grade 2 students are going to have an execursion on the next Tuesday.

  It is about 20 kilometers, involving harsh turn and steep incline occassionally. Therefore everyone must wear sneakers and universe school garments. As for lunch, there are not offical provisions, just prepare it by yourselves, but any dump of rubbish is forbidded.

  Note that if it is raining, the activity will be postponed.
