Good morning,
  My name is Li Hua. It is my honor to speak here. The latest Sunday, that said, April 17, a poem reading match hold in our school. There were about two hundred students joined the match, reading a poet they wrote and sharing what they feel.

  The match hold successfully, not only attracting a lot of students to join, but also gaining a high reputation in public and stress. Thanks to the match, the mania of poems is pervading among our school and even society. Enjoy poems!
